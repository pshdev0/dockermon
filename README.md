# How to Run
* In a terminal run `docker_chs up`.
* In a separate terminal, navigate to the `dockermon` repo root directory, and run `mvn javafx:run`.
* Alternatively, type `./run-dockermon.sh` in the terminal (Mac, Linux) (you may need to `chmod +x run-dockermon.sh` first)
# Information
* Active containers are marked with a âœ…, old containers with a ðŸ›‘
* Click "Clean" button to remove old containers from the list
* Click "Clear log" button to clear the selected log
* Click "Reload" to reload a selected service. Eventually the reloaded service will be picked up, just wait a while like you would if running `docker_chs reload` in the terminal.
* Any new logs entries appearing 5 seconds after any earlier log entries will be separated by a space for readability.
* Any green icons âœ… will light up for 3 seconds when the corresponding service has new logs.
* Select log text and CTRL+C to copy log text
* Click "Split" button to split the view vertically. You can CTRL + Left Click another container to view that second container.
# TODO
* Add a Refresh button to clear all processes and refresh.
* Add AWS key checking to see if they've cleared, and add an AWS button to refresh the keys
* Add VPN connection status - I think we can use `ping -c 3 websenseproxy.internal.ch`
* Add search function
* Add Dockermon refresh button to force a logs flush
* Add UI to enable/disable services, modules, development mode etc.
# Troubleshooting
* If after running you see no containers in the list, try deleting the `org.fxmisc.richtext` repo in you hidden `~/.m2` folder (and other related dependencies if that doesn't work)
